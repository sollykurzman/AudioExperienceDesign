# AudioExperienceDesign - Elements
Elements maps global weather signals into an auditory experience. Inspired by rain drums and wind chimes, to create a calming an satisfying audio experience, while gaining some insight into cultural sounds from the userâ€™s chosen location on the map. The goal was to create a greater sense of connection with the outdoor world despite spending increased amounts of time indoors.

The user was directed to select a location and time (up to 1 year prior) on a world map to select weather data for this location and time. This information was then interpreted and related to metrics that impact the audio created.
